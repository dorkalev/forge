# Forge Command Map (Codex)

Use this map to choose the right Forge command spec quickly.

- Start new ticket work: `references/commands/start.md`
- Load and spec a ticket: `references/commands/load.md`
- Main finalize flow: `references/commands/finish.md`
- Fix PR bot findings: `references/commands/fix-pr.md`
- Compliance check (read-only): `references/commands/audit.md`
- PR compliance body build: `references/commands/verify-pr.md`
- Cleanup merged worktree/branch: `references/commands/cleanup.md`
- Help routing and command summaries: `references/commands/help.md`

Codex compatibility notes:
- Replace Claude-only command invocations with equivalent shell/MCP/API actions.
- Replace AskUserQuestion with direct user chat questions.
- Keep workflow outputs aligned with Forge expectations.
