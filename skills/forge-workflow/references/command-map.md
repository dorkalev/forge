# Forge Command Map (Codex)

Use this map to choose the right Forge command spec quickly.

- Start new ticket work: `../../commands/start.md`
- Load and spec a ticket: `../../commands/load.md`
- Main finalize flow: `../../commands/finish.md`
- Fix PR bot findings: `../../commands/fix-pr.md`
- Compliance check (read-only): `../../commands/audit.md`
- PR compliance body build: `../../commands/verify-pr.md`
- Cleanup merged worktree/branch: `../../commands/cleanup.md`
- Help routing and command summaries: `../../commands/help.md`

Codex compatibility notes:
- Replace Claude-only command invocations with equivalent shell/API actions.
- Keep user-visible workflow outputs aligned with Forge expectations.
