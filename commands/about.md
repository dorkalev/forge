## Forge: SOC2 Compliance as a Superpower

Most teams see SOC2 compliance as a burden - a tax on velocity that slows
everything down. Separate tickets, audit trails, change management reviews,
documentation requirements... it all adds up to friction.

Forge flips this on its head.

### The Problem

Traditional SOC2 compliance in software development means:
- Manual ticket creation and linking
- Separate documentation processes
- Context switching between tools
- Audit prep as a distinct (painful) activity
- Developers avoiding the process, then scrambling before audits

### The Forge Approach

Forge bakes compliance into the natural development workflow:

**One command to start** (`/forge:start`)
- Creates Linear ticket with full context
- Sets up branch, PR, and worktree automatically
- Links everything bidirectionally
- Audit trail created as a side effect of working

**One command to finish** (`/forge:finish`)
- Validates all compliance requirements
- Runs tests and code review
- Ensures ticket linkage is complete
- Pushes only when everything passes

**Zero extra steps for compliance**
- Every commit traces to a ticket
- Every PR documents its changes
- Every decision is captured in specs
- Auditors get a clean trail without developer effort

### The Result

Teams using Forge report:
- Faster feature delivery (fewer context switches)
- Cleaner audit trails (compliance by default)
- Less stress during audit season (always audit-ready)
- Better documentation (specs written as you work)

**SOC2 compliance isn't slowing you down. It's your competitive advantage.**
