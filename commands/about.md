## Forge: SOC2 Compliance as a Superpower

Most teams see SOC2 compliance as a burden — separate tickets, audit trails,
documentation requirements, context switching between tools. Forge flips this.

### The Forge Approach

Compliance is baked into the natural development workflow:

**One command to start** (`/forge:start`)
→ Creates Linear ticket, branch, PR, worktree — all linked bidirectionally.
  Audit trail created as a side effect of working.

**One command to finish** (`/forge:finish`)
→ Validates compliance, runs tests and code review, ensures ticket linkage,
  pushes only when everything passes.

**Zero extra steps for compliance**
→ Every commit traces to a ticket. Every PR documents its changes.
  Every decision is captured in specs. Auditors get a clean trail
  without developer effort.

**SOC2 compliance isn't slowing you down. It's your competitive advantage.**

Run `/forge:help` to see available commands.
